# vscode-react-typescript-jss

-------------------

This extension contains code snippets for React with Typescript with JSS. 
It was created based on infeng's https://github.com/infeng/vscode-react-typescript.

## Installation

In order to install an extension you need to launch the Command Pallete (Ctrl + Shift + P or Cmd + Shift + P) and type Extensions.
There you have either the option to show the already installed snippets or install new ones.

Launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl + P or Cmd + P), paste the following command, and press enter.

`ext install vscode-react-typescript-jss`

Alternatively you can open the extensions panel and search for 'Typescript React + JSS code snippets'.

## Assumptions

The code generated by the snippets assumes that you are using Typescript + React + JSS for styling 
* The component has its own folder, with the style and react code in it. 
* The react file is named "index.tsx"
* The style file is named "index.jss.ts"
* The style uses a theme kept in a separated file, shared by all components

Ex:
```
- button
    + index.tsx
    + index.jss.ts 
- sidebar
    + index.tsx
    + index.jss.ts
...
+ theme.ts
...

```

## Supported languages (file extensions)

* TypeScript (.ts)
* TypeScript React (.tsx)
